[SonarLint VisualStudio Extension](www.sonarlint.org/visualstudio/) is the IDE based static code analysis tool from SonarSource. It performs live code analysis i.e. highlighting violations as you type with potential fixes. It can be used in two modes:

1. Connected : Bind solution to a project on SonarQube. SonarLint will pick-up rules from the server and apply them in IDE.
2. Offline : In the offline mode, SonarLint will create a local ruleset file in the project which has to be configured to apply rules you want.
